Let's pass an environment variable to our `lambda` function.

We can do that by adding a prop to our `helloLambda` function in the stacks file:

```ts
const helloLambda = new lambda.Function(this, "HelloLambda", {
    environment: { isProduction: "absolutely not" }
});
```
</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:33" end="0:43">

Let's `console.log` our variable:
```ts
console.log("isProduction?", process.env.isProduction);
```
</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:52" end="1:05">

Once you've deployed, you'll be able to see the log. Click on **Test** in the `aws` console and checkout the **Environment variables**.
